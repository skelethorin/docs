## Cosmovisor (recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Cosmovisor">
    Configure Cosmovisor per the official tutorial so it manages your `sunrised` binary under `~/.sunrise/cosmovisor/`. Enable:

    ```bash
    export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow governance proposals">
    Upgrades are scheduled via on-chain governance. Confirm proposed **height** and **target binary version** before the event.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic switch at upgrade height">
    With Cosmovisor, the process switches to the prepared binary at the scheduled height with minimal downtime. Ensure your `upgrades/<name>/bin/sunrised` is present beforehand.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual upgrades (no Cosmovisor)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the correct tag">
    Check the **network** repository for your chain (e.g., `sunrise-1`) and the latest release on GitHub for the required `sunrised` version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build and install">
    ```bash
    cd ~/sunrise || git clone https://github.com/sunriselayer/sunrise.git && cd sunrise
    git fetch --all
    git checkout <NEW_TAG>
    make install
    sunrised version
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart and verify">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop sunrised || true
    sunrised start &
    curl -s localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Soft vs Hard Fork

- **Soft fork**: same chain-id, binary changes handled by an upgrade handler; Cosmovisor can automate.
- **Hard fork**: new `genesis.json` and often a **new chain-id**; syncing starts from height 1; follow migration notes provided in the proposal.
