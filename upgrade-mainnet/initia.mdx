description: "How to handle Initia node upgrades using Cosmovisor (auto) or manual binary replacement."
---

## Recommended: Cosmovisor (auto-upgrade)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Cosmovisor during setup">
    If you used **Weave**, select the **automatic upgrades via Cosmovisor** option in the wizard. This will wire your node so new binaries are picked up at governance-scheduled heights.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Service layout & env">
    Cosmovisor expects a directory layout under `~/.initia/cosmovisor/` with `genesis/` and `upgrades/<name>/bin/`. When an upgrade triggers, the daemon switches to the new binary automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor upcoming proposals">
    Keep an eye on governance proposals that schedule upgrades. Confirm the **target version tag** and the **upgrade height** before the event.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual upgrade (if not using Cosmovisor)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the target tag">
    Identify the correct **release tag** for your network (Mainnet `interwoven-1` or Testnet `initiation-2`). Use the official releases and notes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build or download the new binary">
    ```bash
    cd ~/initia || git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/initia.git && cd initia
    git fetch --all
    git checkout <NEW_TAG>
    make install
    initiad version
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop, replace, restart">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop initiad || true
    # If using a static path, ensure $(which initiad) now points to the new binary
    sudo systemctl start initiad
    journalctl -u initiad -f
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-upgrade checks">
    ```bash
    initiad version
    curl -s localhost:26657/status | jq .result.node_info.network
    curl -s localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If your node falls behind or you upgraded late, consider **state sync** or a **snapshot** provider compatible with your chain and height. Always verify integrity and provenance.
