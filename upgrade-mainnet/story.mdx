## Upgrade story-geth

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop services">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop story-geth || true
    sudo systemctl stop story || true
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install new story-geth binary">
    ```bash
    cd $HOME
    curl -L -o story-geth https://github.com/piplabs/story-geth/releases/latest/download/geth-linux-amd64
    chmod +x story-geth && sudo mv story-geth /usr/local/bin/story-geth
    story-geth version
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start story-geth
    sudo systemctl start story
    journalctl -u story-geth -f -o cat
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Upgrade story (consensus)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Manual binary switch">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop story

    # Download new binary
    cd $HOME
    curl -L -o story https://github.com/piplabs/story/releases/latest/download/story-linux-amd64
    chmod +x story && sudo mv story /usr/local/bin/story

    sudo systemctl start story
    story version
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Schedule with Cosmovisor (recommended)">
    ```bash
    # 1) Place the new binary
    export UPGRADE_NAME=<upgrade_name>
    mkdir -p $HOME/.story/story/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE_NAME/bin
    cp /usr/local/bin/story $HOME/.story/story/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE_NAME/bin/

    # 2) Schedule at announced height
    source $HOME/.bash_profile || true
    cosmovisor add-upgrade $UPGRADE_NAME $HOME/.story/story/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE_NAME --force --upgrade-height <height>

    # 3) Monitor
    journalctl -u story -f -o cat
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Always confirm **target versions** and **upgrade height/time** from official announcements before scheduling. Ensure the node is fully synced and has free disk space.
