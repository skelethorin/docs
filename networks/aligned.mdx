## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Aligned Layer?">
    Aligned Layer operates as an AVS (Actively Validated Service) on EigenLayer, and does not require a traditional wallet UI like Metamask. However, any wallet or tooling that supports Ethereum staking and EigenLayer restaking (e.g., MetaMask + EigenLayer frontend, or CLI tools) can be used to interact with the system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a fee?">
    Yes. Krews charges a 10% commission on staking rewards. This commission is applied to any earnings you receive from participating in proof verification through Aligned Layer. Rewards may be distributed based on the pay-per-verification or subscription-based staking model adopted by the network.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    Aligned Layer does not have its own unbonding logic. If you are restaking ETH or other assets via EigenLayer, the unbonding period depends on EigenLayer’s unbonding parameters, which typically range from 7 to 10 days, but may vary depending on the staking configuration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I stake with Krews on Aligned Layer?">
    1. Stake ETH (or supported assets) via EigenLayer.
    2. Opt in to Aligned Layer as an AVS.
    3. Delegate to Krews Validator if selection is available.
    4. Your stake contributes to securing Aligned’s proof verification layer.
    5. You will start receiving rewards proportional to your stake, minus the 10% commission.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I claim and restake rewards?">
    Rewards are distributed automatically through EigenLayer’s mechanisms. To increase your stake, you can manually restake additional ETH or ALIGN via EigenLayer’s dashboard. Krews does not currently offer auto-restake functionality for Aligned Layer.

    <Note>
      Ensure your wallet has enough ETH to cover transaction fees when claiming or restaking.
