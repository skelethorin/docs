## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Celestia?">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there fees or commissions?">
    Transactions pay gas in **TIA**. Validator commissions are set by each validator and shown in staking dashboards; check the validator’s profile before delegating.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    Celestia currently enforces a **21-day unbonding period**. During unbonding, TIA is locked and does not earn rewards. (An upgrade proposal/roadmap item targets ~14 days, but mainnet parameters today remain 21 days.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I stake TIA?">
    1) Install a supported wallet (e.g., Keplr or Leap).  
    2) Fund your wallet with **TIA**.  
    3) Open a staking portal (e.g., explorers.guru Celestia validators), pick a validator, and **Delegate**.  
    4) Confirm in your wallet to start earning per protocol rules.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I claim and restake rewards (auto-compound)?">
    Rewards can be claimed in your wallet or via the staking UI. Auto-compounding is **not automatic by default**, but many validators enable it via **REStake** using Cosmos **Authz**—you can opt-in and revoke at any time.
