title: "Celestia"
description: "Celestia is the first modular blockchain network that provides a dedicated data availability layer for scalable rollups and modular blockchains. By decoupling consensus and data availability from execution, Celestia enables developers to deploy their own sovereign rollups with minimal setup and security overhead. Krews operates highly available Celestia validators and RPC nodes, ensuring consistent block propagation, accurate validator performance metrics, and stable uptime for delegators."

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Celestia?">
    You can use wallets that support Cosmos SDK–based chains. Common options include **Keplr**, **Leap**, and **Cosmostation**.\
    To interact with Celestia’s staking dashboard, connect one of these wallets to the [Celestia Staking Portal](https://staking.celestia.explorers.guru/).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a fee?">
    Yes. Krews charges a **20% commission** on staking rewards. The APR displayed on Celestia staking dashboards represents the network’s gross yield before commission deductions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    Celestia enforces a **21-day unbonding period**.\
    After submitting an unbond transaction, your **TIA tokens** remain locked and non-transferable for 21 days. Once this period ends, you can withdraw or redelegate your tokens freely.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I stake with Krews on Celestia?">
    1. Install a Cosmos-compatible wallet (Keplr, Leap, or Cosmostation).
    2. Deposit your **TIA tokens** to your wallet address.
    3. Visit the [Celestia Staking Portal](https://staking.celestia.explorers.guru/validators).
    4. Connect your wallet and search for **Krews Validator** in the validator list.
    5. Click **Delegate** and enter the amount of TIA you wish to stake.
    6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
    7. Once the delegation is confirmed, you’ll start earning staking rewards in the next block cycles (minus Krews’s 10% commission).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I claim and restake rewards?">
    Rewards can be claimed directly from your wallet or via the staking dashboard under **“Withdraw Rewards.”**\
    To compound your yield, use the **“Delegate More”** or **“Restake”** option after claiming.

    <Note>
      Currently, Celestia does not support automatic compounding through REStake. All restaking actions must be performed manually via your wallet or the staking interface.\
      Always ensure you have a small amount of **TIA** left unbonded to cover gas fees.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the minimum delegation amount?">
    There is **no fixed minimum** required by the network, but most dashboards enforce a small threshold (usually around **0.1 TIA**) to cover gas costs efficiently.
