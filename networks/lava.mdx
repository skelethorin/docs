## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Lava?">
    Lava is a Cosmos-SDKâ€“based network that decentralizes blockchain data access. Providers serve RPC/API relays via an off-chain protocol; staking, pairing, payments, and incentives are settled on-chain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported?">
    Common Cosmos wallets include **Keplr** and **Leap** (Ledger supported). You can add the Lava chain directly in these wallets per the official docs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there fees?">
    On-chain transactions pay gas in **LAVA**. For RPC/API usage, developers buy on-chain subscription plans measured in **Compute Units (CU)**; rewards are distributed to providers based on relays served and QoS.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    The staking unbonding period is currently ~**21 days** (Cosmos staking module). Parameters can change via governance; always check current chain parameters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I stake or delegate LAVA?">
    Add the Lava chain in a supported wallet (e.g., Keplr/Leap), choose a validator, and delegate. Rewards accrue per protocol rules; after starting an unstake, funds become withdrawable once the unbonding period ends.
