## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Espresso?">
    Wallet support depends on the integrated rollup and release. Most Espresso-enabled rollups use Ethereum-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask), but the exact choice is determined by each rollup’s stack and UI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a fee?">
    Users continue to pay gas on the chains they interact with. For builders/integrations, Espresso exposes a fee token contract on L1 to deposit ETH for HotShot data-processing fees; working balances are tracked by HotShot.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    Espresso is currently in “Mainnet 0”, where only a fixed set of preregistered operators can run nodes; broad public staking/delegation parameters (including unbonding) are not publicly applicable yet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Espresso support staking and delegation?">
    Yes, by design the network transitions to proof-of-stake in later releases. During Mainnet 0, participation is permissioned; public delegation details will be provided with the PoS upgrade and accompanying docs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I test or integrate a rollup with Espresso?">
    Use the official docs. Espresso maintains a persistent testnet (Decaf) and provides integration guides (e.g., Arbitrum Nitro/Orbit, OP-stack). Start on testnet, then follow the release-specific mainnet instructions.
