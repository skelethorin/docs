description: "Espresso is a global confirmation network and shared sequencer for rollups. Using the HotShot BFT consensus, Espresso provides fast, credible confirmations and optional decentralized sequencing/DA, improving security and cross-chain composability for L2s. Krews is not currently a mainnet validator on Espresso; this page summarizes network concepts and official resources."

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Espresso?">
    Espresso integrates with rollups that typically use Ethereum-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask). Operator and integration flows may also interact with L1 contracts. Exact wallet support depends on each integrated rollup and release.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a fee?">
    Krews does **not** charge a commission here because we are **not** accepting delegations on Espresso. User gas costs (if any) are paid on the relevant chain(s). Espresso’s design includes L1 fee plumbing (e.g., a <code>fee_contract</code>) for sequencing fees defined by network configuration.
    <Note>We’ll document any operator commissions only if/when public delegation to Krews becomes available on Espresso.</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    As of <strong>Oct 20, 2025</strong>, Espresso mainnet is in a “Mainnet 0” phase with a fixed, preregistered operator set. Public staking/delegation for end-users is not broadly open; therefore a public unbonding period is not quoted here.
    <Note>Parameters will be updated once the proof-of-stake release opens broader participation.</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do rollups use Espresso?">
    Rollups can use Espresso’s global confirmation network for fast confirmations and (optionally) shared sequencing/DA. Start from the official docs’ integration guides (e.g., Nitro/OP Stack pages) and the “Build on Espresso” entries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I test or follow status?">
    Espresso maintains a persistent testnet (Decaf) and lists current releases in the docs. Mainnet 0 is live (permissioned). Check the website/docs for testnet instructions and public endpoints as they evolve.
