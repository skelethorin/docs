## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Espresso?">
    Espresso is a global confirmation layer and shared sequencer for rollups. It leverages the HotShot BFT consensus so rollup transactions can be credibly confirmed within seconds, providing early, shared certainty before L1 finality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Espresso live on mainnet?">
    Yes. Espresso is live as “Mainnet 0,” a production phase with a preregistered operator set and a roadmap toward broader proof-of-stake participation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported?">
    Wallets depend on the integrated rollup and release. Most Espresso-enabled rollups use Ethereum-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask); operator/integration flows may also interact with L1 contracts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are fees handled?">
    Builders deposit ETH into an L1 fee-token contract to pay HotShot data-processing fees; HotShot tracks working balances. Withdrawals are planned in a future release. Users otherwise pay gas on the chains they interact with.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I test or integrate a rollup with Espresso?">
    Use the persistent **Decaf** testnet and the official integration guides in the docs. Start on testnet, then follow release-specific mainnet instructions as they evolve.
