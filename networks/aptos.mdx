## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Aptos?">
    Aptos is a Layer-1, proof-of-stake blockchain that uses the Move programming language, designed for asset safety and expressive smart contracts. The network implements parallel execution (Block-STM) to improve throughput and latency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Aptos?">
    Aptos supports multiple Move-compatible wallets. Common options include **Petra** (by Aptos Labs) and third-party wallets such as **Martian** and **Pontem**. Dapps integrate wallets via the Aptos Wallet Adapter standard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a fee?">
    Yes. Transactions pay gas in **APT**. Fees include execution/IO costs and storage fees; gas parameters are configurable via on-chain governance. Developers can specify gas price and limits; users typically just confirm in their wallet.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding (unlock) period?">
    Aptos uses delegated staking. You can request to unlock at any time, but funds become **withdrawable only after the delegation pool’s lockup cycle ends**. The lockup duration is set by governance and can vary by pool/cycle; always check the pool’s current unlock date in the UI.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I stake or delegate APT?">
    1. Install a supported wallet (e.g., Petra).
    2. Open the official explorer or a partner interface that supports delegated staking.
    3. Choose a validator / pool and delegate your APT.
    4. Rewards accrue per protocol rules; when you unlock, you can withdraw after the pool’s lockup cycle ends.
