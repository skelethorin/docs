## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Sunrise?">
    Sunrise works with Cosmos SDK–compatible wallets such as <strong>Keplr</strong>, <strong>Leap</strong>, or <strong>Cosmostation</strong>. You can also use the Sunrise App to delegate or manage locked assets as described in the docs. Availability of features (governance, staking views, etc.) may vary by wallet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    Sunrise enforces a <strong>21‑day unbonding period</strong>. After submitting an undelegation, your RISE or vRISE remains locked and non‑transferable for 21 days; once the period ends, funds become withdrawable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I stake on Sunrise?">
    1. Install a Cosmos‑compatible wallet (e.g., Keplr or Leap) and connect it to the Sunrise network or open the Sunrise App.<br/>
    2. Acquire <strong>RISE</strong> (or manage <strong>vRISE</strong> if applicable) and choose a validator from the staking interface.<br/>
    3. Submit a <em>Delegate</em> transaction and keep a small balance for gas.<br/>
    4. To change validators without waiting, use <em>Redelegate</em> (subject to chain rules).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there validator commissions or fees?">
    Yes. Each validator sets a <strong>commission rate</strong> on staking rewards. Review a validator’s commission and performance before delegating. Network gas fees also apply to transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I claim and restake rewards?">
    Rewards can be claimed from your wallet or the Sunrise App’s staking page. To compound, claim rewards and delegate them again to your chosen validator. Always leave a small amount of RISE for gas.
