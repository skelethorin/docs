By unifying execution, networking, and economics, Initia enables developers to launch interoperable app‑chains (“Minitias”) while the L1 provides shared security, routing, and liquidity primitives."

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Initia?">
    You can use the official <strong>Initia App</strong> to manage assets and staking across the ecosystem, as well as Cosmos‑compatible wallets like <strong>Leap</strong>, <strong>Keplr</strong>, or <strong>Cosmostation</strong>. Feature coverage can differ by wallet, so prefer the Initia App or Leap for the most complete experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    Initia currently uses a <strong>21‑day unbonding period</strong> on the L1. After initiating an undelegation, your INIT becomes withdrawable only after the 21‑day window completes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I stake on Initia?">
    1. Connect a supported wallet or the Initia App to the <strong>interwoven‑1</strong> network (mainnet).<br/>
    2. Fund your address with <strong>INIT</strong> and open the staking/validators page.<br/>
    3. Select a validator, review commission and uptime, then submit a <em>Delegate</em> transaction.<br/>
    4. To switch validators without unbonding, use <em>Redelegate</em>.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there commissions or minimums?">
    Validator <strong>commissions</strong> are set per operator and displayed in wallets/dashboards. Network gas fees apply. Minimum delegation is determined by the interface you use (wallets often enforce small thresholds for practicality).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I claim and restake rewards?">
    Claim staking rewards in your wallet or the Initia App. To compound, delegate the claimed INIT again. Keep a small balance to cover gas when claiming or redelegating.
