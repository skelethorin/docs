title: "Avail"
description: "Avail is a Substrate-based, modular data-availability layer designed to provide scalable, decentralized data storage for downstream blockchains. By separating settlement from data-availability, Avail enables developers to deploy rollups, DA chains, and other layer-2 systems with minimal overhead. As a validator service, Krews operates high-performance nodes on the Avail network, ensuring reliable block production, robust finality, and continuous uptime for our delegators."
