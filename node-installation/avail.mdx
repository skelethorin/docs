title: "Avail"
description: "Avail is a Substrate-based, modular data-availability layer designed to provide scalable, decentralized data storage for downstream blockchains. By separating settlement from data-availability, Avail enables developers to deploy rollups, DA chains, and other layer-2 systems with minimal overhead. As a validator service, Krews operates high-performance nodes on the Avail network, ensuring reliable block production, robust finality, and continuous uptime for our delegators."

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported for Avail?">
    Any wallet that supports Substrate-based networks and has Avail configuration will work. Common options include Talisman, Polkawallet, SubWallet, or Polkadot.js (configured for Avail).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a fee?">
    Yes. Krews charges a 10% commission on staking rewards. The APR displayed on your dashboard reflects the network’s gross yield before deducting Krews’s commission.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period?">
    Avail enforces a **28-day unbonding period**. When you decide to unstake, your AVAIL tokens enter a 28-day lockup during which they do not earn rewards and cannot be transferred. After 28 days, you are free to withdraw or redelegate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I stake with Krews on Avail?">
    1. Install and configure a compatible wallet (e.g., Talisman) with Avail’s network endpoint.
    2. Transfer AVAIL tokens into your staking account.
    3. Visit the Avail Staking Dashboard (e.g., https://staking.avail.tools).
    4. Connect your wallet and search for “Krews Validator” under the validator list.
    5. Submit a nomination (bond) transaction to delegate your AVAIL to Krews.
    6. Once the next era is reached, your stake becomes active, and you start earning rewards (minus our 10 % commission).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I claim and restake rewards?">
    You may claim rewards manually via the Staking Dashboard by clicking “Withdraw Rewards” under your account’s staking page. To compound your yield, use the “Bond Extra” function to re-delegate the claimed AVAIL in a single transaction. Krews does not currently offer an auto-restake (REstake) service on Avail; all restaking must be performed manually.

    <Note>
      Always ensure you have enough AVAIL in your wallet to cover transaction fees. If you plan to withdraw or redelegate, account for the 28-day unbonding lock-up period before your funds become available again.
