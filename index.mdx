## Who We Are

Krews is a validator and infrastructure team formed by professionals who have worked together across multiple projects. We combine practical ops experience with dedicated, bare-metal infrastructure to deliver secure, reliable staking services. Our goal is simple: empower projects and communities with verifiable performance and transparent operations.

## Our Mission

- **Security First** — Enterprise-grade, dedicated servers (ECC memory, power and data redundancy) and a global sentry topology designed to minimize downtime and slash risk.
- **Reliability at Scale** — Bare-metal only, with carefully tuned setups for predictable performance under load.
- **Transparency** — We surface validator behavior, performance, and network health via public dashboards and explorers.
- **Sustainability** — We prioritize energy-efficient choices and practices to reduce carbon footprint without sacrificing performance.

## What We Do

- **24/7 Live Monitoring & Incident Response**\
  Continuous monitoring with automated alerting and human on-call. We detect anomalies fast and remediate quickly.
- **Bare-Metal Infrastructure & Sentries**\
  Dedicated servers only—no shared virtualization. Global sentry nodes harden network access and increase resilience.
- **Open Reporting**\
  Public dashboards, explorers, and weekly status views so delegators and teams can audit us in real time.
- **Documentation & How-Tos**\
  We maintain docs and runbooks so operators and delegators can follow clear, repeatable processes.
