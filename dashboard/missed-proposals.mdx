## What is a missed proposal?

A **missed proposal** occurs when the designated proposer does not produce a valid block in the allotted round, leading to a round increment and a new proposer. This often manifests as:

- **Longer block intervals** (temporary spike in **Block Time (Avg)**), and
- Diagnostic traces showing round transitions.

## How to use the page

- Watch the **red markers/lines** for misses and compare with block interval changes.
- Correlate streaks of misses with **network health** or **regional outages**.
- Export segments where available for incident reviews.
