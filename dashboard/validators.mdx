The **Validators** page provides a real-time overview of validator health, participation, and stake distribution. It combines high-level KPIs with an interactive table so you can quickly pivot from macro trends to specific operators.

## Key KPIs

- **Active Validators / Inactive Validators** — Count of validators currently in the active set versus those outside the set. Useful for tracking churn and network participation.
- **APR** — Network staking Annual Percentage Rate before validator commission. Values can vary by era/epoch and network economics.
- **Min Stake** — The smallest effective stake among validators in the **active** set. Indicates the current threshold to enter/maintain active status.
- **Avg. Commission** — Mean commission rate of the active set. Helps estimate post‑commission yield.
- **Block Time (Avg)** — Rolling average of block intervals. Spikes often correlate with network congestion or proposer round retries.
- **Bonded Tokens** — Total staked tokens securing the network.
- **Total Delegators** — Count of unique delegator accounts across validators.

**Time windows:** Top charts support **7D / 1M / 3M / All** to analyze short‑term vs long‑term trends for **Block Time**, **Bonded Tokens**, and **Total Delegators**.

## Validators Table

Sortable & searchable table with the following columns:

- **Moniker** — Validator display name.
- **Voting Power** — Effective stake. Sort to inspect concentration.
- **Cumulative Share** — Cumulative distribution curve position. Reveals how quickly stake concentrates.
- **Delegators** — Number of delegators bonded to the validator.
- **Uptime** — Observed signing participation over the selected window.
- **Commission** — Validator fee charged on rewards.

### Usage Scenarios

- **Find concentration risk:** Sort by **Voting Power** and read the **Cumulative Share** to detect the top X validators holding a majority of stake.
- **New delegator discovery:** Filter by **Commission** and **Uptime** to shortlist operators.
- **Trend audit:** Track **Block Time (Avg)** and **Bonded Tokens** together to correlate performance with staking behavior.

### Tips

- Use the search box to find a moniker or operator address.
- Combine column sorting with the top KPI charts’ time window for context.
- Click any validator row to open a detailed view (where supported by the network).
