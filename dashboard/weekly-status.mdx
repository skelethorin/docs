The **Weekly Status** page aggregates validator performance by ISO week, creating a consistent baseline for comparisons over time.

## Headline Cards

- **Active Validators** — Validators observed as active during the selected week.
- **Highest / Lowest Uptime** — Best and worst weekly uptime among validators.
- **Avg. Mean Uptime** — Average of validators’ **mean uptime** during the week.
- **Net VP Change** — Sum of positive minus negative **Voting Power** changes across validators for the week.
- **Total VP Change** — Aggregate absolute VP movement (adds both increases and decreases).
- **Delegator Change** — Net change in the number of delegator accounts.
- **Replacements** — Count of operators that entered or exited the active set.

## Rankings

- **Top 5 Performers** — Validators with minimal misses and highest mean uptime.
- **Bottom 5 Performers** — Validators with elevated misses or low uptime.
- **Overall Uptime Range** — Distribution of weekly uptime (min–max bands).
- **VP Change Distribution** — Histogram showing stake shifts across operators.

## Table Columns

- **Moniker / Address**
- **Mean Uptime** (percentage) and **Mean Uptime (float)** (exact decimal, e.g., 99.3650%)
- **Max / Min Uptime**
- **Missed** — Count of missed blocks/proposals for the week (network‑specific logic)
- **Signed** — Signed block count
- **VP Change** — Voting Power change in the week

### How metrics are computed

- **Mean Uptime**: Average signing participation over all relevant blocks in the week for a validator.
- **Missed / Signed**: Derived from per‑block signatures; chain clients can expose this via RPC or indexers.
- **VP Change**: Computed from week‑start vs week‑end stake snapshots per validator.

### How to read the page

- Look at **Avg. Mean Uptime** to understand overall network health.
- Use **Top/Bottom 5** to spot outliers and potential incidents.
- Cross‑reference **VP Change Distribution** with **Delegator Change** to see if stake movement is retail‑ or whale‑driven.
