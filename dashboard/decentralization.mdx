The **Decentralization** page maps nodes/validators globally, surfacing geographic and provider concentration.

## What you see

- **Map view** with pins per node/validator. Popovers include **moniker**, **provider**, **location**, and (when available) **IP**.
- **Stats**: **Total Nodes**, **Countries**, **Providers**.
- **Charts**:
  - **Nodes by Country** — Which jurisdictions host the most nodes.
  - **Nodes by Provider** — Cloud/DC concentration.
- **Node List** table with **Moniker**, **Region**, **Country**, **City**, **Provider** and filters.

## Why decentralization matters

- **Jurisdictional risk**: Excess concentration in a single country increases correlated regulatory or outage risk.
- **Single‑provider risk**: Heavy reliance on one provider (e.g., a large cloud) creates common‑mode failure exposure.
- **Routing & latency**: Global spread can improve propagation and proposer timing stability.

## Practical analysis

- Filter by **provider** to check for outsized dependence (e.g., a single hyperscaler).
- Inspect **country** distribution before onboarding more validators or recommending infra choices to delegators.
- Use the table to verify operator diversity (regional mix, providers, and cities).
