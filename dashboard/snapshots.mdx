The **Snapshots** page hosts ready‑to‑use **Archive** and **Pruned** snapshots for supported networks. Each entry shows block height, file sizes, DB backend, and client versions.

## Archive vs Pruned

- **Archive**: Retains full historical state. Heavier disk usage; best for research and full indexing.
- **Pruned**: Keeps recent state with historical pruning. Significantly smaller; ideal for production nodes when full history isn’t required.

## Update cadence

- Snapshots are generated **hourly**. The page shows the **last updated time**, current **block**, and **file sizes**.

## Quick restore

Use the inline command block under each snapshot entry. Typical (example) pattern for compressed tarballs:

```bash
# Stop services and back up sensitive files (e.g., priv_validator_state.json on CometBFT-based chains)
sudo systemctl stop <service>

# Restore (example; adjust URL and paths)
curl -L <SNAPSHOT_URL> | lz4 -dc - | tar -xf - -C <DATA_DIR>

# Restart and follow logs
sudo systemctl restart <service> && journalctl -u <service> -f -o cat
```

<Note>
  Always back up **priv_validator_state.json** before restoring a snapshot to avoid double‑sign scenarios on consensus‑based chains.
